# AeroFetch

AeroFetch is a sleek, lightweight, and powerful HTTP client built on the Fetch API, designed to make web requests faster, smoother, and more intuitive. Just like aerodynamics optimizes speed and efficiency, AeroFetch streamlines API calls with a clean, modern interface while maintaining full flexibility for developers.

## Features

- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: AeroFetch supports the Server-Sent Events protocol, allowing servers to push real-time updates to clients. This makes it simple and efficient to build real-time data streams, notification systems, or any application that requires the server to actively send data to the client.

- **WebSocket**: In addition to traditional HTTP requests, AeroFetch supports the WebSocket protocol, enabling bidirectional communication between the client and server. This provides strong support for building real-time chat applications, online games, collaborative editing tools, and more.

With these features, AeroFetch not only meets the needs of traditional request-response patterns but also adapts to the growing demand for real-time and interactive capabilities in modern web applications.
